# Fetch
With the prevalence of COVID-19, it has forced the world in the state of pandemic.
Everyday, the numbers of new cases just keep on rising. The Government has initiated a
community quarantine in an attempt to lower these numbers. This has forced most of us to stay
within the safety of our own homes. But even with quarantine, particularly among Filipinos, it
doesn't take away the need for us to get out daily needs. Families still have to get food on their
tables. We still need to go out to get groceries and market goods. So this defeats the purpose of
keeping people within their households because they would still need to go outside. This is where this web appliation comes in.

Introducing, Fetch! Fetch is a web application that lets users order goods from their local
supermarkets or suppliers and have those delivered at their doorsteps. All the users need to do
is choose the things they want to order, proceed to checkout, choose their mode of payment,
and bam!, a week's supply of food for their family is coming their way. And since it is ordered
from only within their city, it would only take hours or even minutes for it to reach their
homes. This way, they wouldn't need to step outside just to buy their needs because they can
use Fetch to “fetch” their needs!

The tools used to create this web application are html, css, js. Along with the bootstrap framework.

# Learnings
I've learned a lot in creating this project. I've learned to see the world in a bigger picture and understand the perspective of others. 
Putting yourself in one's shoe is a very important trait as you get to understand how they feel and what's best for them. Which lead me to coming up with Fetch!

In this course, I've learned a lot of technical things Web related. From the basics of HTML to the application of Bootstrap. Learning is not easy, though with determination, 
we can push through. And arguably, that's the best thing I've learned here. To keep this determination going so that I can face more challenges up ahead!

To pinpoint something, it would be the general knowledge of frameworks and tools. I want to challenge myself to learn more of these tools. So that I have a lot of weapon
in my arsenal. When I have those, improvement in UI, UX, Server-side Scripting and many more will follow.

To a brighter future!
